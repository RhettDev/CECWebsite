# CECWebsite
This repository holds the Curtin Engineers Club website, developed by Rhett Bauchop.

# Purpose 
Currently the online presence of the Curtin Engineers Club is limited to social media (Facebook and Instagram), a Linktree and TidyHQ. Whilst acceptable, a central website will allow a professional look and hub for members to find information about the club.
The webiste is intended to work in conjuction with the social media accounts and TidyHQ, making the LinkTree redundant. This website will not be used for event ticketing as that is covered by TidyHQ already, additionally, social media has immediate viewing the website might now have.

# Goal Features
The website aims to be a digital platform of information about the club that members can reference. It should include what the club is about, the current committee, sponsorship information and event descriptions. As well as miscellaneous links that regard the club. There are no aims to have ticket sales, membership signups or personal data stoarge through the website.
