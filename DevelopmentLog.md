# Development Log
THe purpose of this file is to log updates to the development of the website. This log is starting at the tail end of the design process when code development is about to start. 
Additionally this log might aid future developers in debugging or continuing progress of the webite. Whilst I (Rhett B) understand GitHub is a development log, this log is more general in keeping track, and that I want to do this :) 


Below is a template of a development log to be used by authors, current and future.

## 04/10/25 Dev Log 0.1.2
main Branch, Rhett Bauchop
### Goal: Finally Linked GitHub
After around six weeks of development, all done locally on my laptop, my GitHub account has finally been able to push to the repo.
### Leason: Reseting users logged in
There was a cache that I did not know about that had kept my user data from another GitHub account that did not have permissions to push to the website repo. Once that was deleted and my active account was signed back in, I was able to sync the repo and local files.
### Issue: Learn how to transfer all data to another repo with another account
Currently the entire repo is under my personal account (RhettDev) where it should eventually be only used by accounts with a CEC email. This ensures only certain people will gain access to editing the repo, and that the contact email will be availble to recover the repo in any case of personal email loss.
