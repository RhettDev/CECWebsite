# Development Log
THe purpose of this file is to log updates to the development of the website. This log is starting at the tail end of the design process when code development is about to start. 
Additionally this log might aid future developers in debugging or continuing progress of the webite. Whilst I (Rhett B) understand GitHub is a development log, this log is more general in keeping track, and that I want to do this :) 


Below is a template of a development log to be used by authors, current and future.
